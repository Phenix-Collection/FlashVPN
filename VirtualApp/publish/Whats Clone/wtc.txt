Notes:
• Permissions: WhatsClone needs to apply for the permissions required by the apps added in WhatsClone to function normally. For example, if WhatsClone is not permitted to acquire your location, you will be unable to send your location to your friends in some apps that run in WhatsClone. In addition we won't collect any of your personal information to protect privacy.
• Consumptions: WhatsClone itself doesn't take up too much memory, battery and data by which are actually consumed by the apps running inside.
• Notifications: Please add WhatsClone to whitelist or exceptional list of some 'boost apps' to ensure that notification of some social networking apps functions well.
• Conflict: You cannot run two accounts of some social networking apps by using a same mobile number. You should use a different mobile number to run your second account of those apps in WhatsClone and ensure that the mobile number is active during your first login because there will be a verification message sent to this number.
