    <string name="text_Q1_title">Q1: Why cannot I receive message notifications from Super Clone enabled apps?</string>
    <string name="text_Q1_content_2">A1: Please ensure that Super Clone has network access</string>
    <string name="text_Q2_title">Q2: Will Super Clone collect and use my private information?</string>
    <string name="text_Q2_content">A2: No, Super Clone will only collect small amounts of your “public data” (e.g. Avatar, nickname etc), and these will only be used within your device to create a better user experience for you. Super Clone promises that none of your private data will be collected or used.</string>
    <string name="text_Q3_title">Q3: Why is Super Clone’s storage consumption increasing?</string>
    <string name="text_Q3_content">A3: All sub-accounts added on your device are by default listed under Super Clone by the Android operating system. For example, when you add a Facebook sub-account to your device, all of the storage used for your second Facebook account (app) is listed under Super Clone. Therefore, the storage consumption listed for Super Clone will appear to increase significantly when you add more sub-accounts. Rest assured that the storage consumption of Super Clone itself is not actually increasing by much.</string>
    <string name="text_Q4_title">Q4: Why has Super Clone used up so much storage space?</string>
    <string name="text_Q4_content">A4: All sub-accounts added on your device are by default listed under Super Clone by the Android operating system. The large amount of storage consumption listed under Super Clone is the overall total storage used for all sub-accounts you’ve added. Super Clone itself uses little storage.</string>
    <string name="text_Q5_title">Q5: How does Super Clone’s Private App function protects my privacy?</string>
    <string name="text_Q5_content">A5: A password is required to access Private Apps each time you wake your device. Additionally, all Private Apps are installed on Super Clone, and therefore all Private Apps’ data are not accessible by any external programs.</string>
